# Guide on how to add features to the repo

1. Either create a fork or a branch of the repo... load it on your local storage (you might want to install git lfs just so that you can have a safe installation of the large manifest file)
2. Once that is done... Install all the python library dependencies (You can refer to the requirements file for that)
3. To run the python scripts

        On the cmd, move to the parent directory, which should be something like : `../FinalMethylationWebsite

        Next enter: `streamlit run <script_name>.py`
        Example: streamlit run index.py
